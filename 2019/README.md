# Google-Code-Jam 2019<br>
<h2>Foregone Solution</h2> <br>

<h3>Problem</h3> <br>
<p>Someone just won the Code Jam lottery, and we owe them N jamcoins! However, when we tried to <br>
print out an oversized check, we encountered a problem. The value of N, which is </br>
an integer, includes at least one digit that is a 4... and the 4 key on the </br>
keyboard of our oversized check printer is broken.
<br>
Fortunately, we have a workaround: we will send our winner two <br>
checks for positive integer amounts A and B, such that neither A nor <br>
B contains any digit that is a 4, and A + B = N. Please help us find any pair of <br>
values A and B that satisfy these conditions.<br>
</p>
<h3>Input</h3>

<p>The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, <b>T</b>. <b>T</b> <br>
  test cases follow; each consists of one line with an integer <b>N</b>. <br></p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: A B, where x <br>
is the test case number (starting from 1), and A and B are positive integers as <br> 
described above. <br>
